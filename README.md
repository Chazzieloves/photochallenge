## Design

### Color Scheme

![Color pallet](documentation/color_pallet.png)

- A black background was used to make a depth in the background to better highlight the photographies I added design to the background it gives the effect of cameras flashing. This will make the photographers associate it with something they love doing, taking breathtaking phos.

- I used white text color to make the text easily read. It also gives photos displayed on the website more room for colors without the background disturbing.

- White color was used to maintain the neutral colors on the logo and leave a more room for the photos to be the center of attention.



### Typography

url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:ital@1&family=Urbanist&display=swap');

- Urbanist Google Font was used as the font of the website in order to increase the simplicity of the content on the pages.


I didn´t have time to finish more than what I have done, so far, due to problems with codeanywhere workspace credits, I lost a lot of valuable study time. I have asked Student Care to get an extension for the lost study-time, but I haven´t heard back from them yet. So this is what I´ve got so far. I hope I will be abled to show you the finished wbesite.
