## Design

### Color Scheme

- A background gradient in black and dark purple was used to make a depth in the background to better highlight the photographies. I added a design to the background on the submit-response page, that gives the effect of cameras flashing. This will make the photographers associate it with something they love doing, taking breathtaking phos.

- I used white text color to make the text easily read. It also gives photos displayed on the website more room for colors without the background disturbing.

- Backgroundcolor was used to enhance the next challenge and the last month challenge winner.



### Typography

[Google Font](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cinzel:wght@500&family=Cormorant:wght@300&family=Dancing+Script:wght@700&family=Rock+Salt&display=swap)

- Cormorant Google Font was used as the font of the website in order to increase the creative space of the content on the pages.
- Cinzel Google Font was used as the font of the logo in order to make a clean and minimalistic impression.
- Dancing Script Google Font was used as the font of the next month challenge in order to make it fit the challenge.
- Rock Salt Google Font was used as the font of this month challenge winner in order to draw attetion to the challenge winner.
